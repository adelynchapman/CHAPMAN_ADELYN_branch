## github-tutorial


This repository contains all the lovely code for my FCOR 599 project. Within the dark recesses of my hard drive are many python and R scripts which are used to:
1. Extract Landsat and Sentinel bands
2. Clip GEDI data to the study area
3. Calculate indices based on landsat and sentinel bands

If you want to use these scripts to calculate aboveground biomass, feel free to borrow them :)
